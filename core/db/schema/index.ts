/**
 * Database Schema Index
 *
 * This file aggregates all database table schemas for the DevCle project.
 * Currently empty, but will be populated in Task 3.2 with:
 * - tenants: Multi-tenancy support
 * - developers: Developer/user profiles
 * - organizations: Company/organization data
 * - activities: User activity tracking
 * - identifiers: Identity resolution (email, GitHub, etc.)
 *
 * All schemas will be exported from this file and imported by:
 * - drizzle.config.ts: For migration generation
 * - db/connection.ts: For type-safe query building
 *
 * Schema Design Principles:
 * - Every table includes tenant_id for RLS (Row Level Security)
 * - Timestamps: created_at, updated_at for audit trails
 * - UUIDs for primary keys (better for distributed systems)
 * - JSONB for flexible metadata storage
 */

// Placeholder export to satisfy TypeScript
// Will be replaced with actual table schemas in Task 3.2
